## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@yourproject.com](mailto:security@yourproject.com)
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's security advisory feature
3. **Private Message**: Contact maintainers directly through GitHub

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include the following information in your security report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, authentication bypass)
- **Affected component** (frontend, backend, API, database)
- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Response Timeline

We will respond to security reports within the following timeframes:

- **Initial Response**: 24-48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: As quickly as possible (typically within 30 days)

### Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help us improve our security. If you report a valid security vulnerability, we will:

- Credit you in our security advisories
- Add you to our security hall of fame
- Consider monetary rewards for significant vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Backend (Laravel) Security

1. **Input Validation**
   ```php
   // Always validate input
   $request->validate([
       'email' => 'required|email|max:255',
       'password' => 'required|min:8',
   ]);
   ```

2. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   ```php
   // Use Eloquent ORM or Query Builder
   $users = User::where('email', $email)->get();
   ```

3. **CSRF Protection**
   ```php
   // Ensure CSRF middleware is enabled
   Route::middleware(['web', 'auth'])->group(function () {
       // Protected routes
   });
   ```

4. **Authentication**
   ```php
   // Use proper authentication middleware
   Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum'])->group(function () {
       // API routes
   });
   ```

5. **Environment Variables**
   ```php
   // Never commit sensitive data
   // Use .env for configuration
   $apiKey = env('API_KEY');
   ```

#### Frontend (React) Security

1. **Input Sanitization**
   ```typescript
   // Sanitize user input
   const sanitizeInput = (input: string) => {
       return input.replace(/<script\b[^<]*(?:(?!<\/script>)<[^<]*)*<\/script>/gi, '');
   };
   ```

2. **XSS Prevention**
   ```typescript
   // Use React's built-in XSS protection
   <div>{userInput}</div> // Safe
   // Avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML unless necessary
   ```

3. **API Security**
   ```typescript
   // Always use HTTPS in production
   const apiUrl = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
       ? 'https://api.yourdomain.com' 
       : 'http://localhost:8000/api';
   ```

4. **Token Management**
   ```typescript
   // Store tokens securely
   // Use httpOnly cookies when possible
   // Implement token refresh logic
   ```

### For System Administrators

1. **Server Security**
   - Keep operating system updated
   - Use firewall to restrict access
   - Enable SSL/TLS encryption
   - Regular security audits

2. **Database Security**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Limit database user privileges
   - Enable database encryption
   - Regular backups

3. **Application Security**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Monitor for security vulnerabilities
   - Implement logging and monitoring
   - Use security headers

## Security Headers

We implement the following security headers:

```php
// Laravel middleware for security headers
return $next($request)
    ->header('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff')
    ->header('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY')
    ->header('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block')
    ->header('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains')
    ->header('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin')
    ->header('Content-Security-Policy', "default-src 'self'");
```

## Dependency Security

### Automated Security Scanning

We use the following tools to scan for vulnerabilities:

- **Backend**: `composer audit`
- **Frontend**: `npm audit`
- **Container**: `docker scan`

### Manual Security Review

Regular security reviews include:

1. **Code Review**: All code changes are reviewed for security issues
2. **Dependency Audit**: Regular updates of dependencies
3. **Penetration Testing**: Periodic security testing
4. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Regular vulnerability scans

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process

1. **Detection**: Identify and confirm security incident
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
3. **Investigation**: Determine scope and impact
4. **Eradication**: Remove threat and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems and services
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve processes

### Communication Plan

- **Internal**: Notify team members immediately
- **Users**: Communicate impact and remediation steps
- **Public**: Issue security advisory if necessary
- **Regulatory**: Comply with applicable regulations
